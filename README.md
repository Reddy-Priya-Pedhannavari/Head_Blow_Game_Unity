## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Launch Head Blow and press Play.
2. **Movement:** Use the keyboard to move, walk, and jump around the 3D field.
3. **Collect Points:**  
    - **Blue objects:** Positive points; collect these to reduce or maintain your head size and stay alive longer.  
    - **Brown objects:** Negative points; avoid these as they can increase your head size.
4. **Survive:** Your head grows automatically every few seconds. The game ends when your head reaches the maximum size.
5. **Score:** Survive as long as possible and collect positive points to achieve a high score!
